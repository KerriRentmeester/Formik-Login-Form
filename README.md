# **Project Name**:  

Formik Login Form

# **Description**: 

*This is a simple login form with validation using Formik. The form includes the following: 
- An Email field
- A Password field
- A Submit Button

*The form implements the following input validation rules:
- If the username or password inputs are empty, display the message "field required" under the text input.
- If the username is not in an email format, display the message "username should be an email" under the text input.
- If the username and password pass the validation above, then display the message "Login Successful" in an `alert` box.

*Formik is a small library that helps with the three aspects of creating forms in React:
- Getting values in and out of the form state
- Validation and error messages
- Handling form submission
By collocating all three of the above in one place, Formik will keep things organized; thereby, making testing, refactoring, and reasoning about forms a breeze.

*This simple React App is an example of my Javascript coding capabilities in learning how to create React Apps. This is a project I created from my MIT bootcamp "Professional Certificate in Coding: Full Stack Development with MERN."

# **Installation & Usage**: 

*This repo is missing the folder titled node_modules.
*This takes a long time to load because it has to download the dependencies and then start the React development server._
*Clone the repository or download the code files. Navigate to the project directory in your terminal. Install the necessary dependencies by running the following command: npm install Start the development server with the following command: npm start
*The project relies on the following dependencies: React, Formik, Bootstrap
