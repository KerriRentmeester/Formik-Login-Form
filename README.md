# **Project Name**:  

Formik Log In Form

# **Description**: 

This is a simple login form with validation using Formik. The form includes the following: 
- An Email field
- A Password field
- A Submit Button

The form implements the following input validation rules:
- If the username or password inputs are empty, display the message "field required" under the text input.
- If the username is not in an email format, display the message "username should be an email" under the text input.
- If the username and password pass the validation above, then display the message "Login Successful" in an `alert` box.

Formik is a small library that helps with the three aspects of creating forms in React:
- Getting values in and out of the form state
- Validation and error messages
- Handling form submission
By collocating all three of the above in one place, Formik will keep things organized; thereby, making testing, refactoring, and reasoning about forms a breeze.

The Formik Log In Form project is an example of my ability to create a React app, employ Babel transpiler, and my JSX, Javascript, HTML5, and css coding capabilities, and as such, it is one component of my professional portfolio. This particular project is based off of similar activities I worked on in July of 2023 in module 13 of the MIT xPro via Emeritus bootcamp I was enrolled in called "Professional Certificate in Coding: Full Stack Development with MERN."

**I changed the original course task styling in the following ways:**
* Added a title
* Altered the button's color, padding, text weight, and border.
* Elongated the text input fields
* Added padding and background color to the body

# **Installation & Usage**: 

To run my project on your machine, download the files onto your machine or clone the repo. Navigate to the project directory in terminal. Install the necessary dependencies by typing the command prompt: npm install. Start the server by typing the command prompt: npm start.

If you are having issues, ensure the version of Node.js you are using is compatible.

This takes a long time to load because it has to download the dependencies and then start the React development server.

# **Dependencies**: 

The project relies on the following dependencies: React, Bootstrap, Babel, Formik

# **Support**: 

Please contact me via email at krentmeester@uwalumni.com

# **Roadmap**: 

* Add a border around log in form with a distinct background color
* Center the log in form
* Add restrictions to password (certain length, variety of characters, etc.)
* Add a sign up option as an alternate.
